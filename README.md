# Grayscale-filter
This is my first ever JavaScript program to create a grayscale image of uploaded image. 
This program lets user to upload an any image of any file type to the page. 
The convert button let user to convert the image into a grayscale image.
Converted image is shown in another canvas infront of the uploaded image.
